	DEPRECATED; Base interface for all evented objects.

	Evented objects are owned by the fiber/task that created them and may only be used inside this
	specific fiber. By using release(), a fiber can drop the ownership of an object so that 
	another fiber can gain ownership using acquire(). This way it becomes possible to share
	connections and files across fibers.
